                <p class="paragraph">The events of the novel take place between 1946 and 1948, primarily on the Near
                    Northwest
                    Side of Chicago. The title character is Francis Majcinek, known as "Frankie Machine", a
                    young man who is a gifted card dealer and an amateur drummer. While serving in World War II,
                    Frankie is treated for shrapnel in his liver and medicated with morphine. He develops an
                    addiction to the drug, although initially in the story he believes he can control his habit.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">Frankie lives in a small apartment on Division Street with his wife, Sophie
                    (nicknamed
                    "Zosh"). Sophie has been using a wheelchair since a drunk-driving accident caused by Frankie
                    (although the novel implies that her paralysis is psychological in nature). She spends most
                    of her time looking out the window and watching the nearby elevated rail line. She takes out
                    her frustrations by fighting with her husband, and she uses his guilt to keep him from
                    leaving her. The turmoil in their relationship only spurs on his addiction.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">He works nights dealing in backroom card games operated by "Zero" Schwiefka. He
                    aspires to
                    join the Musicians' Union and work with jazz drummer Gene Krupa, but this dream never
                    materializes. His constant companion and protégé is "Sparrow" Saltskin, a feeble-minded
                    thief who specializes in stealing and selling dogs; Frankie gets Sparrow a job as a
                    "steerer", watching the door to the card games and drawing in gamblers.</p>
